# To code

* Evaluations: rename disparity as MSE, calculate disparity angle, plots with anaglyphs, store angles

* Move all parameters to config files
* Change parameters to match Charles'
* Create procedure file independent from experiment file
* Add fine scale images to plots (e.g. upscaling coarse images and replacing their centers with fine images)
* Switch from DQN to actor-critic
* Repeat experiment with only random actions and compare resulting autoencoder
* Make episode environments in multiprocesses
* Stereoscopic anaglyphs?
* Adapt code to use with CPU
* Run through SSH? 
* Tensorboard?

# To think

* Compare pyrender environment values with Charles'.
* How do we evaluate the vergence performance?
* Find ground truths relation between angles and texture distance
